### MNIST Neural Network Exploration

Kaggle competition submission for the MNIST [digit recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).

Examined two different types of neural netorks:

1. Fully connected sequential neural network using almost only dense layers.

2. A convolutional sequential neural network

The former achieved approximately 97.6% accuracy, while the latter achieved approximately 99.1% accuracy.
